In this blog post, we're going to talk about a very interesting math problem: the Helmholtz equation and how we can "solve" it using something called quadrature formulas. 

Imagine we're studying how waves move in a certain space, like a homogeneous half-plane (a half-plane with the "same" properties everywhere). And we're curious about the interference phenomenon (when waves meet and do interesting things :) ). 

Our goal will be then to compute the solution to the Helmholtz equation:

$$
-\Delta u - (\omega^2 + i\varepsilon)u = 0 \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^+ \times \mathbb{R}
$$

$$
u = \delta(x, y - y_0) \text{ on } \{0\} \times \mathbb{R}
$$

Here, $$\delta$$ represents the Dirac delta function at $$(0, 0)$$, $$\omega$$ signifies the angular frequency of the wave, and $$\varepsilon \geq 0$$ (typically small) symbolizes the attenuation of the medium. The Dirac function embodies a point source positioned at $$y_0$$. 

It appears that by leveraging the Fourier transform and truncating the resulting integral, we can demonstrate that:

$$
u_0(x, y) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-T}^{T} e^{-i\xi(y-y_0)} e^{i\sqrt{\omega^2 + i\varepsilon - \xi^2 }} d\xi~,~~ \forall x > 0,~ y \in \mathbb{R}
$$

The trick here is that we are going to be using quadrature formulas to help us out. These formulas make it relatively easier to deal with tricky integrals but can sometimes be computationally expensive.

Here are some examples playing with the parameters $$\omega = 15$$, $$p = 100$$ and $$\varepsilon = 1.0j$$:

Keeping the same parameters but only changing angular frequency of the wave $$\omega=20$$:
