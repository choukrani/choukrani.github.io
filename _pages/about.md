I'm Omar, a MEng student majoring in $\mathsbb{A}$ pplied $\mathbb{M}$ athematics and `Computer Science` at [National Institute of Applied Sciences](https://www.insa-rouen.fr/) in France.

I'm passionate about Optimization, Statistics, Algorithms and all the theory behind AI and also about its applications from theorems provers to LLMs.

Currently, I'm actively seeking internship opportunities to further apply and expand upon my passion for these areas.
